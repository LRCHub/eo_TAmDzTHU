```lrc
[00:24.32] Your flag, your alibi
[00:27.33] Can you hide behind
[00:29.82] Claiming might is right?
[00:41.82] 
[00:32.21] Raise your fist to the sky
[00:35.29] While below your boots
[00:37.61] Common men die
[00:44.61] 
[00:39.53] Colors fly
[00:40.97] Tell us who to love and who to hate
[00:43.05] And by the by
[00:44.72] Will the memories of our morals fade?
[00:47.32] Staying true
[00:48.88] To your own convictions in this haze
[00:50.99] Is harder to do than say
[01:02.99] 
[00:54.50] So choose a color to live by
[00:59.63] Your goal, your faith, your virtue
[01:02.16] Give it all
[01:04.16] Be the best 'cause nothing less will do
[01:23.66] 
[01:08.59] You can rule the world with colors flying high
[01:15.22] You'll know that if you stay true
[01:17.49] Green or blue
[01:19.48] Red or white
[01:21.16] You can't lose
[01:23.13] With your colors flying high
[01:37.13] 
[01:49.53] Your ethics: problematic
[01:52.74] It's clear that we
[01:54.97] Don't see eye to eye
[02:04.97] 
[01:57.45] We have to find a balance
[02:00.49] A common line
[02:02.68] Or we'll fall hard
[02:11.68] 
[02:04.43] Our colors rise
[02:06.36] Tell us who to hate, who to adore
[02:08.50] And as you try
[02:10.17] To sort out what you've been fighting for
[02:12.68] Take your hands
[02:14.21] Go and draw the line into the sand
[02:16.17] And show them all
[02:17.70] Where you stand
[02:25.20] 
[02:20.25] So choose your colors true and bright
[02:25.14] As hero, liege or sinner
[02:27.36] Give it all
[02:29.47] Be the best 'cause nothing less will do
[02:48.97] 
[02:33.97] If you must go down with colors flying high
[02:40.24] You know you're still a winner
[02:42.98] Pink or pale
[02:44.67] Black as night
[02:46.58] You can't fail
[02:48.33] With your colors flying high
[03:02.33] 
[03:21.93] So choose the color you will fly
[03:26.78] Fight on for your convictions
[03:29.46] Give it all
[03:31.32] Be the best 'cause nothing less will do
[03:35.77] You can rule the world with colors flying high
[03:42.12] Believe in your ambitions
[03:45.16] Green or blue
[03:46.30] Red or white
[03:48.67] You can't lose
[03:50.03] With your colors flying high
